// You are given an array of positive integers as input. Write a code to return the length of the largest such subsequence in which the values are arranged first in strictly ascending order and then in strictly descending order.
// Such a subsequence is known as bitonic subsequence. A purely increasing or purely decreasing subsequence will also be considered as a bitonic sequence with the other part empty.
// Note that the elements in bitonic subsequence need not be consecutive in the given array but the order should remain same.
// Input Format:

// Line 1 : A positive Integer N, i.e., the size of array
// Line 2 : N space-separated integers as elements of the array 

// Output Format:

// Length of Largest Bitonic subsequence

// Input Constraints:

// 1<= N <= 100000

// Sample Input 1:

// 6
// 15 20 20 6 4 2

// Sample Output 1:

// 5

// Sample Output 1 Explanation:

// Here, longest Bitonic subsequence is {15, 20, 6, 4, 2} which has length = 5.
